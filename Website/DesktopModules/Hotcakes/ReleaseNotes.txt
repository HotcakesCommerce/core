<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>#16 - Remove SKU from admin views</strong> - removed "Pro" SKU in the footer of the admin views.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>#7 - Source array was not long enough. Check srcIndex and length, and the array's lower bounds</strong> - Added logic to prevent Hotcakes view engine from being added to the collection multiple times. This logic addresses a memory leak and a race condition which can cause a site to crash.</li>
	<li><strong>#20 - .NET Can Incorrectly Detect Browser Cookie Compatibility</strong> - In some instances, .NET would report that cookies aren't supported, which wouldn't allow products to be added to the cart.</li>
	<li><strong>#24 - Reverted Hotcakes Cloud-Specific MVC Version Update</strong> - The Hotcakes Cloud environment defaulted to a different version of MVC. Recent updates have changed that, which no longer requires this workaround.</li>
</ul>
